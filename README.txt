Comment_upload.module allows users to attach files to individual comments. If the attached file is an image, it's displayed inline in the resulting comment. Otherwise, a hyperlink to the file is displayed after the comment's body.

This started as chx's proof-of-concept project to demonstrate the new hooks in Drupal 4.7's comment.module. Then eaton got his hands on it and started hacking with it. It's still very early in the development cycle, and will continue to grow as 4.7 approaches RC and final release.
